One of my main passions is rowing. I've been a member of the UEA Rowing Club for a little more than a year, and I currently serve as the coxswain for my team. As a coxswain, I'm responsible for steering the boat, coordinating the rhythm and power of the rowers, and making tactical decisions during races.

I've always been fascinated by food and the food industry. I love discovering new flavors and keeping up with the latest trends. But it's not just about taste for me - I also care about food safety, nutrition, and sustainability.
That's why I'm excited about the chance to work for Bakkavor. You're a company that takes these issues seriously and creates fresh, nutritious products people can feel good about.
Combining my love for cooking with the opportunity to work on meaningful projects as part of a team would be a dream come true. I'm eager to learn, work hard, and contribute to creating amazing food that makes a positive impact.

The Engineering Graduate Programme sounds amazing because it's a hands-on opportunity to get involved in setting up food processing and packaging equipment, while making sure everything meets strict food safety standards. With my strong project management and problem-solving skills, I'm excited to use these skills to deliver projects that can directly impact the food industry. I love that the programme involves working across different Bakkavor sites, so I can really understand the business and build a strong network. Ultimately, this programme is the perfect path to becoming an expert project manager in the food industry, which is my long-term career goal.

I'm excited about the chance to work for Bakkavor because you're a world leader in fresh-prepared foods. I love how Bakkavor is always coming up with new, innovative products for big UK supermarkets. As someone who's passionate about cooking and food, I'd love to work in a fast-paced environment with diverse teams to create high-quality products that make people happy. Bakkavor's commitment to being the best is something I really connect with â€“ I'm always pushing myself to improve and deliver to the best of my abilities.

Despite the setback, my crew was satisfied with their effort and performance.
We ultimately won the race against the other novice boats.
Receiving the winners' pot at the end of the day further validated our hard work and resilience.

My first reaction is to stay calm and focused regardless the pressure. I gave clear and quick commands to help the crew navigate out of the bushes and resume rowing in rhythm.
Once we started racing again, I needed to sound positive, and determined to get them their win by keeping the rowers' spirits high by reminding them that we were there to fight for the win and encouraging them to demonstrate their determination.
As we regained our racing pace, I consistently motivated the crew, acting as their biggest fan and providing technical adviceto help them maintain their performance.


During a novice men's 8+ race in Cambridge, our boat had to overtake another crew in a narrow section of the river. Immediately after, we encountered a tight corner and clashed our blades with bushes, causing us to stop for 15 seconds. As the cox, I had to decide how to get out of this situation and motivate the rowers to continue racing.

In my university, I often take on leadership roles within group projects and extracurricular activities. I enjoy contributing my skills in organization, communication, and problem-solving to help my teams succeed. For example, I frequently volunteer to coordinate meetings, gather and disseminate important information, and mediate any communication issues that may arise. I believe that taking on these responsibilities not only helps my teams function more effectively but also allows me to develop valuable leadership skills that will serve me well in my future career.

While I do not currently hold any formal leadership titles outside of my rowing commitments, I am always eager to step up and take on additional responsibilities when the opportunity arises. I believe that leadership is not just about holding a title, but about having the initiative and the nessesary skills to be usefull and support others towards a common goal by removing obstacles they deal with the best.

I have extensive experience working as part of a team, particularly in my role as a coxswain for a rowing crew. As a coxswain, I spend at least 8 hours a week on the water, being fully responsible for my crew's safety, motivation, and performance. This role requires strong leadership skills, effective communication, and the ability to make quick decisions under pressure. I also collaborate closely with my crew to develop race strategies, provide technical feedback, and foster a positive team dynamic.

In addition to my coxing duties, I coach land training sessions for the rowing team twice a week. This involves planning and leading workouts, providing guidance on proper technique, and motivating athletes to push themselves and improve their fitness. Coaching requires a different set of skills than coxing, including the ability to break down complex movements, provide constructive feedback, and adapt to the needs and abilities of individual athletes.

I want to join BA's Supply Chain Graduate Scheme because I combine analytical skills with proven leadership experience. As a coxswain in rowing, I've developed strong decision-making abilities under pressure and learned to coordinate complex operations - skills directly applicable to supply chain management. My experience leading rowing crews taught me to communicate clearly and make quick, strategic decisions while managing resources effectively.
I'd particularly enjoy rotating through different supply chain roles and contributing to BA's sustainability projects, like their work on eco-friendly aviation fuel. The skills I've gained in motivating teams and optimizing performance as a cox would be valuable in implementing operational improvements and managing cross-departmental projects.
Through this scheme, I'd gain valuable experience in airline operations while building on my existing leadership capabilities. Learning from experienced professionals would help me grow into an effective supply chain leader who can help BA continue to innovate and excel in the aviation industry, just as I've helped rowing teams achieve their peak performance through strategic coordination and resource management.
